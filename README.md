## Scenario Description:
Our project outlines a comprehensive structure for managing a movie streaming platform, focusing on user engagement, content personalization, and subscription management. 

It supports both individual and family accounts, allowing users within a family account to have separate profiles linked to a shared subscription. Users can manage their genre preferences, watch lists, and watch history within an account. Movies can be filtered and searched by details such as genre, release year, age rating, etc. Additionally, users can give reviews by rating and commenting on movies they have viewed, which may be of benefit to other users. Subscription plans define pricing and streaming quality, with payment records tracking billing details. 

Our model integrates user activity, feedback, and account information to create a seamless movie streaming experience, all while providing insights about content and user engagement that allows management to optimize profitability and customer satisfaction.
